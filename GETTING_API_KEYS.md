---

## 1. Google Gemini API Key (Required) ‚≠ê

### Why needed?
Powers AI analysis: content quality, site type detection, holistic insights, strategic recommendations.

### How to get it:

1. **Go to:** https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Choose **"Create API key in new project"** (or select existing project)

### Why needed?
Enables detailed Performance tab with:
- Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Optimization opportunities with time savings
- Full PageSpeed Insights report link

**Without PSI key:** You'll still get basic performance metrics, but no detailed Performance tab.

### How to get it:

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/pagespeedonline.googleapis.com
2. **Select or create** a Google Cloud project
3. Click **"Enable"** on PageSpeed Insights API
4. Go to **Credentials**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
5. Click **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"API Key"**
6. **Copy the key**
7. *(Optional)* Click **"Restrict Key"** ‚Üí Select "PageSpeed Insights API" for security
8. **Paste into SEO AIditor**

### Free tier limits:

- ‚úÖ **Unlimited requests per minute**

**PSI is very generous** - you likely won't hit the limit.

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Where are keys stored?

**By default:** `sessionStorage` (browser session only)
- Keys are deleted when you close the browser tab
- Most secure option
- You'll need to re-enter keys on next visit

**Optional:** `localStorage` (persistent)
- Check ‚òëÔ∏è "Remember keys in this browser"
- Keys saved until you clear browser data
- **Only use on trusted, personal devices!**

### Important:
- ‚úÖ Keys stored **only in YOUR browser** (client-side)
- ‚úÖ Keys sent to server **only during analysis** (HTTPS recommended)
- ‚úÖ Keys **never logged** or saved on server
- ‚úÖ Keys **never visible** to SEO AIditor developers
- ‚ùå Never share your API keys publicly
- ‚ùå Don't commit keys to GitHub

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Gemini API key"

**Possible causes:**
- Key not copied fully (must start with `AIza...`)
- Key not activated yet (wait 1-2 minutes after creation)
- API not enabled in Google Cloud Console

**Solution:**
1. Go back to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Copy the ENTIRE key (should be ~39 characters)
3. Try creating a new key if problem persists

### "Rate limit exceeded - Gemini API"

**What happened:** Free tier limit = 5 requests per minute

**Solution:**
- Wait 60 seconds before next analysis
- OR upgrade your Gemini plan at https://ai.google.dev/pricing

### "PageSpeed API error" / "PSI timeout"

**Don't worry!** PSI key is optional.

**What you'll miss:**
- Detailed Performance tab
- Lighthouse category scores
- Core Web Vitals breakdown
- Optimization opportunities list

**What still works:**
- All other analysis (Technical, On-Page, Content, etc.)
- Basic performance score (mobile)
- AI recommendations
- Issue detection

**Solution:**
- Continue without PSI key (basic analysis)
- OR get PSI key following steps above

### Keys not saving / keep asking for keys

**Check:**
- Is "Remember keys" checkbox checked?
- Did you clear browser cache/cookies?
- Are you in Private/Incognito mode? (use regular browser)

**Solution:**
- Re-enter keys
- Check "Remember keys in this browser"
- Make sure cookies/localStorage enabled in browser
